I presented the topic _Picking up the Blue Shell - Augmenting the Dev Workflow with PowerShell_ on Tuesday at the [Little Rock .NET User Group](http://lrdnug.org/). 

Topic: Explore the current state of Windows PowerShell tooling and how it can be the starting point for daily activities.

- Create a custom environment-tuned profile
- Minimize Windows Explorer usage by navigating with the shell
- Build Cmdlets to extend functionality
- Use the Powershell Gallery to discover and install modules
