The directory tag module for PowerShell, PSDirTag, is now available on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSDirTag/). DirTags are relative paths that appear as variables in the Powershell prompt that update as you navigate.

Check out the [PSDirTag project page](https://github.com/wtjones/PSDirTag) for an overview and installation instructions.
