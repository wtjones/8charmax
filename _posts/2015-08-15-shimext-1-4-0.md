I recently updated ShimExt, a utility that provides Windows Explorer context-menu options such as datestamping files via rename or copy, to version 1.4.0. 

Please visit the [project page]({{ site.url }}/shimext) for more details. Here is the changelog:

1.4.0

  - Added datestamp copy/rename to subfolder in current folder. Balloon tip in system tray notifies user of success.
  - Various fixes related to file operations.
