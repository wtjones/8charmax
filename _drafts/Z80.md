I recently decided to feed an old curiosity by taking a deep dive into Game Boy assembly language development. I've dabbled in the past with x86 and z80 (via a [TI-85](http://tistory.wikidot.com/zshell)), but never made it much further than _hello world_-level examples.

_some text_
**some text**
__some text__

## Goals I had in mind

- Fluency in writing non-trivial code, rather than just reading.
- Work as close to the metal as possible. I often take for granted the conveniences of modern compilers and runtimes.
- Choose an approachable platform with plenty of existing tutorials.
- Create something that demonstrates a basic grasp of the hardware, yet is simple and graphical.

## Platform of choice

Due to my fondness for the [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) processor, I chose the original [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy).

- Powered by a Z80-like CPU by Sharp. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy):
    > This processor is similar to an Intel 8080 in that none of the registers introduced in the Z80 are present. However, some of the Z80's instruction set enhancements over the 8080, particularly bit manipulation, are present.
- Has a homebrew community and documentation.
- Has fairly mature tooling,


## Initial hurdles

### "Hello World" may not be the best starting point

The Game Boy has no built-in text handling support. To display text, one must:

- Store a character set in the ROM. Thankfully, the [ibmpc1](https://github.com/nezticle/rgbds-template/blob/master/inc/ibmpc1.inc) file takes care of this
- Copy the characters to tile memory. Monochrome fonts like ibmpc require a translation to the 4-shade hardware tile format. Not complex, but another mental hurdle for a newcomer.
- Set the desired string in VRAM.

This, combined with the mandatory ROM boilerplate, put me off for a bit in the beginning. I instead started with a [simpler tutorial](http://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/first.txt) and went back to _Hello World_ after a I had a better understanding.

### Project structure standards

I love the idea of project boilerplates, but the [available examples](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev#boilerplates) tend to differ from each other in structure. Choose one that has familiar feel and adjust as needed.

### The ROM requires boilerplate


## The processor

### 8 bit CPUs differ from 16+ bit CPUs in more ways than register/bus size.

#### Stack indexing is limited

The x86 [cdecl convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl) uses the stack for passing function arguments. Here is an example of calling something like `some_func(int a, int b, int c)`

```
push    3
push    2
push    1
call    some_func   ; some_func may access these params via
                    ; offsets of register ebp
```

Local-scope variables may also be allocated on the stack.

To maintain performance due to a [lack of an index register](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/why-do-c-to-z80-compilers-produce-poor-code) on the z80:

- Registers are often used to pass parameters to functions. 
- Global variables are favored over stack-based variables.

This is one of the main reasons that [C is a difficult language](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/6100) for the Z80.


#### The CPU can't do math.

Even though it powers one of the [most common graphing calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series), the Z80 lacks multiply and divide instructions. Instead, these operations are performed in two ways:

- Repeated adds/subtracts via a loop. (slow)
- Bitwise shift operations (fast, but only for powers of two)

Fortunately, I only required power of two operations, so bit shifting sufficed.

#### Look-up tables are essential

In some cases, expensive calculations are necessary during critical sections. Examples could include:

- Multiply/divide non power of two as mentioned previously
- Sine/Cosine
- Random numbers
